Repeat six to eight times throughout the day. How to Cleanse. During the cleanse; you will not eat any solid foods. You will drink 6-8 glasses of Vibrant Cleanse per day. You can have unlimited amounts of water; and herbal tea. You can stay on the cleanse for as little as 3 days and up to 30 days. A 10 day cleansing fast is common.Laxative. Complete elimination and cleansing can be accelerated if desired through the use of an effective laxative herb tea (Senna or Smooth Move) in the morning and/or evening. Most find it more convenient and helpful to drink a gentle laxative tea at night to aid morning elimination.Salt Water Purge. A thorough cleansing of the gastrointestinal tract can be achieved through the additional use of an internal salt water bath composed of two level teaspoons of non-iodized sea salt dissolved in one quart lukewarm water. The entire quart is to be taken on an empty stomach. Total elimination can be expected within an hour or two; and sometimes even more quickly. Multiple eliminations may occur. The salt water purge will quickly flush toxins released during the fast.Post Cleanse: Breaking the Cleansing FastWhen finishing a cleanse slowly reintroduce foods.Day 1. You can drink unlimited amounts of fresh fruit and vegetable juices. It is a good idea to fortify 1 or 2 servings with added Field of Greens or Green Vibrance green food powders.Day 2. You can have unlimited amounts of fruit and vegetable juices; and warm vegetable broth. Again; fortification with Field of Greens or Green Vibrance more quickly replenishes key nutrients.Day 3. You may begin eating whole fruits and vegetables and unlimited vegetable broth.Days 4-10. Now you are ready to introduce other food sources. Vegetables cooked soft; herb teas; fresh vegetable and fruit juices should be used for 5 to 7 days.Day 11+.

We suggest a serving size of 1/4 to 1/2 cup per person. Bring the desired amount of water to a boil - generally double the quantity of oats. In other words; 1/2 cup of oat bran requires 1 cup boiling water. Add our Ultimate Oatmeal to the boiling water and immediately reduce heat. Cook on low heat for 5 to 10 minutes or until desired texture is reached. Use more or less water to change consistency. You can also prepare with nonfat milk or other liquids and sweeten with a small amount of honey or maple syrup. Of course; adding fruits or nuts makes for an even healthier meal. You can also create 'quick' oats by briefly placing Ultimate Oatmeal in a food processor or blender.
